I have included the visitor and node as classes inside the main RBTree file. Doing this has helped me with the Junits test cases.

Everything is working perfectly- poem included is the first stanza from "The Raven" by EAP

Please run the main java file for the main assignment, and then run the Junits test file for the remaining test case template. 

I have also deleted the 2 print functions as they did not serve any purpose in my code. 

Some challenges I faced: implementing the code by deconstructing the visitor and node classes. I included them in the bottom because seperating them would cause my program to crash. 

I also needed to use stringbuffer more efficiently so I wouldnt have to space out the poem.

It was challenging trying to figure out the recursive nature of the functions needed. But reviewing heapsort and the like really helped a lot
