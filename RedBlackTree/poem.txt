once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
while
I
pondered
weak
and
weary
over
many
a
quaint
and
curious
volume
of
forgotten
lore
while
I
nodded
nearly
napping
suddenly
there
came
a
tapping
as
of
some
one
gently
rapping
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
tis
some
visitor
I
muttered
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
only
this
and
nothing
more
